The Primeagen inspired me to start looking into better developer tools and actually start using nvim. Now I have adapted to ghostty and nvim and have come to really like it. Therefore, just want to document my config for when I switch devices or if anyone else actually happens to be interested. I could repeat myself here, but all you need is in my github repo [ghostty-nvim-config](https://github.com/KarlVM12/ghostty-nvim-config).
